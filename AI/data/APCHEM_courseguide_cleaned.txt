(b) (i) For a correct claim: 1 point
The surface area of the solid reactants increases.
(ii) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Shorter than. The powdered solids have a larger surface area than the solid chunks, thus
collisions between water and the surface particles occur more frequently, resulting in a
faster rate of dissolution and a shorter amount of time to dissolve the solids.
(iii) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Equal to. Both experiments begin with the same amount of reactants, so they will produce
the same number of moles of CO (g) under the same conditions of pressure and
2
temperature; therefore, the final volume will be the same.
Total for part (b) 3 points
(c) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Accept one of the following:
• NaHCO is the limiting reactant because changing the mass of NaHCO alters
3 3

(d) For a valid explanation: 1 point
The entropy change is positive because the aqueous reactants produce 2 moles of gas
particles, according to the balanced chemical equation. Gases are far more dispersed
(occupy a greater number of microstates) than condensed phases, so the entropy of the
products is greater than that of the reactants.
AP® Chemistry 2024 Scoring Guidelines
(e) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Accept one of the following:
• Disagree. The reaction is endothermic and has a positive entropy change. Thus,
the reaction is only thermodynamically favorable at a high enough temperature
such that the magnitude of
−T∆S
is greater than that of ∆H .
• Disagree. For the reaction to be thermodynamically favorable (∆G < 0) at all
temperatures, the reaction must be exothermic (∆H 0<) and have a positive
entropy change (∆S > 0).

Accept one of the following:
• The value of ∆T will be smaller because Al has a greater specific heat capacity

transfer applied to the same mass will result in a smaller change in temperature,
according to the equation q = mc∆T .

• Decreased the temperature.
• Added more H and/or I to the reaction vessel.
2 2
(iii) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Accept one of the following:
• Remain unchanged. The number of moles in the numerator and denominator of Q
(or K ) are equal; changing the volume of the container would not alter the value
of Q, which is still equal to K , so the number of moles of HI will remain the
same.
• Remain unchanged. The increase in volume will decrease the concentration of
reactants and products by an equal proportion. Because there are equal moles of
gaseous reactants and products in the balanced chemical equation, there is no shift
in the equilibrium position, and the number of moles of HI will remain the same.

(ii) For the correct answer and a valid justification, consistent with part (c)(i): 1 point
Accept one of the following:
• Agree. The angle of NO + is different from the angle in NO because there
2 2
would no longer be a nonbonding electron on the central atom in NO , and the
2
O atoms would spread farther apart, forming a linear structure with a 180
bond angle.
• Agree. The hybridization of N in NO is sp2 , which would result in a bond

angle of approximately 120. The hybridization of N in NO + is sp, which

Directions:
Section II has 7 questions and lasts 1 hour and 45 minutes.
You may use the available paper for scratch work and planning, but you must write your answers
in the FRQ booklet. Label parts (e.g., A, B, C) and sub-parts (e.g., i, ii, iii) as needed. Use a
pencil or a pen with black or dark blue ink to write your responses.
For each question, show your work for each part in the space provided for that part in the free-
response booklet. Examples and equations may be included in your responses where appropriate.
For calculations, clearly show the method used and the steps involved in arriving at your answers.
You must show your work to receive credit for your answer. Pay attention to significant figures.
A calculator is allowed in this section. You may use a handheld four-function, scientific, or graphing
calculator, or the calculator available in this application. Reference information, including a
periodic table and lists of equations and constants, is available in this application and can be
accessed throughout the exam.
You may pace yourself as you answer the questions in this section, or you may use these optional
timing recommendations:
Questions 1–3 are long FRQ questions. It is suggested that you spend about 23 minutes on
each of those questions. Questions 4–7 are short FRQ questions. It is suggested that you
