(b) (i) For a correct claim: 1 point
The surface area of the solid reactants increases.
(ii) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Shorter than. The powdered solids have a larger surface area than the solid chunks, thus
collisions between water and the surface particles occur more frequently, resulting in a
faster rate of dissolution and a shorter amount of time to dissolve the solids.
(iii) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Equal to. Both experiments begin with the same amount of reactants, so they will produce
the same number of moles of CO (g) under the same conditions of pressure and

(d) For a valid explanation: 1 point
The entropy change is positive because the aqueous reactants produce 2 moles of gas
particles, according to the balanced chemical equation. Gases are far more dispersed
(occupy a greater number of microstates) than condensed phases, so the entropy of the
products is greater than that of the reactants.

Accept one of the following:
• The value of ∆T will be smaller because Al has a greater specific heat capacity

transfer applied to the same mass will result in a smaller change in temperature,
according to the equation q = mc∆T .

(iii) For the correct answer and a valid justification: 1 point
Accept one of the following:
• Remain unchanged. The number of moles in the numerator and denominator of Q
(or K ) are equal; changing the volume of the container would not alter the value
of Q, which is still equal to K , so the number of moles of HI will remain the
same.
• Remain unchanged. The increase in volume will decrease the concentration of
reactants and products by an equal proportion. Because there are equal moles of
gaseous reactants and products in the balanced chemical equation, there is no shift
in the equilibrium position, and the number of moles of HI will remain the same.

What AP® Stands For
Thousands of Advanced Placement teachers have contributed to the principles
articulated here. These principles are not new; they are, rather, a reminder of how AP
already works in classrooms nationwide. The following principles are designed to ensure
that teachers’ expertise is respected, required course content is understood, and that
students are academically challenged and free to make up their own minds.
1. APstandsforclarityandtransparency.Teachersandstudentsdeserveclear
expectations. The Advanced Placement Program makes public its course
frameworks and sample assessments. Confusion about what is permitted in the
classroom disrupts teachers and students as they navigate demanding work.
2. APisanunflinchingencounterwithevidence.APcoursesenablestudentsto
develop as independent thinkers and to draw their own conclusions. Evidence and
thescientificmethodarethestartingplaceforconversationsinAPcourses.
3. APopposescensorship.APisanimatedbyadeeprespectfortheintellectual
freedom of teachers and students alike. If a school bans required topics from their
AP courses, the AP Program removes the AP designation from that course and
its inclusion in the AP Course Ledger provided to colleges and universities. For
example, the concepts of evolution are at the heart of college biology, and a course
that neglects such concepts does not pass muster as AP Biology.
4. APopposesindoctrination.APstudentsareexpectedtoanalyzedifferent
perspectives from their own, and no points on an AP Exam are awarded for
agreementwithanyspecificviewpoint.APstudentsarenotrequiredtofeel
certain ways about themselves or the course content. AP courses instead develop
students’ abilities to assess the credibility of sources, draw conclusions, and make
up their own minds.
As the AP English Literature course description states: “AP students are not
expectedoraskedtosubscribetoanyonespecificsetofculturalorpoliticalvalues,
butareexpectedtohavethematuritytoanalyzeperspectivesdifferentfromtheir
ownandtoquestionthemeaning,purpose,oreffectofsuchcontentwithinthe
literary work as a whole.”
5. APcoursesfosteranopen-mindedapproachtothehistoriesandculturesof
differentpeoples.Thestudyofdifferentnationalities,cultures,religions,races,and
ethnicities is essential within a variety of academic disciplines. AP courses ground
such studies in primary sources so that students can evaluate experiences and
evidence for themselves.
6. EveryAPstudentwhoengageswithevidenceislistenedtoandrespected.
Students are encouraged to evaluate arguments but not one another. AP
classrooms respect diversity in backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. The
perspectives and contributions of the full range of AP students are sought and
considered. Respectful debate of ideas is cultivated and protected; personal
attacks have no place in AP.
7. APisachoiceforparentsandstudents.Parentsandstudentsfreelychooseto
enroll in AP courses. Course descriptions are available online for parents and
studentstoinformtheirchoice.Parentsdonotdefinewhichcollege-leveltopics
are suitable within AP courses; AP course and exam materials are crafted by
committeesofprofessorsandotherexperteducatorsineachfield.APcoursesand
exams are then further validated by the American Council on Education and studies
thatconfirmtheuseofAPscoresforcollegecreditsbythousandsofcollegesand
universities nationwide.
The AP Program encourages educators to review these principles with parents and
students so they know what to expect in an AP course. Advanced Placement is always
achoice,anditshouldbeaninformedone.APteachersshouldbegiventheconfidence
and clarity that once parents have enrolled their child in an AP course, they have agreed
to a classroom experience that embodies these principles.

Framework
Introduction
The AP Chemistry course outlined in this framework reflects what chemistry
teachers, professors, and researchers have agreed is the main goal of a
college-level general chemistry course: to help students develop a robust
conceptual understanding of chemical principles that can be applied to
future coursework and phenomena. The course is designed to enable
students to view chemical phenomena through a variety of conceptual
lenses, and at various levels: macroscopic, microscopic, sub-microscopic,
and symbolic. Throughout the course, students learn to apply a variety of
science practices, such as describing, interpreting, and analyzing models;
designing experiments and analyzing data; creating representations of data
and chemical systems; using mathematical routines to solve problems; and
providing evidence and reasoning to justify a scientific claim.

2 1.2 Simulations
Conduct a simulation of a mass spectrometer, using a strong magnet and steel ball
bearings of various masses, to show students how mass can be used to separate
particles based on their ability to be manipulated in an electromagnetic field. Present
samples of mass spectra for students to analyze and have them calculate the average
atomic mass of an element. Discuss how mass spectrometry could be used to identify
the presence of an element within a mixture and the isotopic abundance within an
element. Forensic science applications and other modern uses of the technology can
be discussed to give relevant context to the concepts.
3 1.3 Think-Pair-Share
Have students design an experiment to determine the percent composition of a
mixture of sodium carbonate (inert) and sodium bicarbonate. After carrying out the
experiment, provide them with a mock student report to analyze and critique. Then
have them get into pairs and reflect on their particular approach and come up with
additional approaches to this problem.

Given ionization energy data from various elements, guide students through a series
of questions to help them rationalize the relationship of the charge of the ion to its
position on the periodic table, its electronic structure, and reactivity.

Due to strong interactions between ions,
ionic solids tend to have low vapor pressures,
high melting points, and high boiling points.

also rigid and hard, because the covalent bond
anglesarefixed.However,graphiteissoft
because adjacent layers can slide past each

3.2.A.5
Molecular solids are composed of distinct,
individualunitsofcovalently-bonded
molecules attracted to each other through
relatively weak intermolecular forces. Molecular
solids generally have a low melting point
because of the relatively weak intermolecular
forces present between the molecules. They
do not conduct electricity because their
valence electrons are tightly held within the
covalent bonds and the lone pairs of each
constituent molecule. Molecular solids are
sometimes composed of very large molecules
or polymers.
3.2.A.6
Metallic solids are good conductors of
electricity and heat, due to the presence of
free valence electrons. They also tend to be
malleable and ductile, due to the ease with
which the metal cores can rearrange their
structure. In an interstitial alloy, interstitial
atoms tend to make the lattice more rigid,
decreasing malleability and ductility. Alloys
typically retain a sea of mobile electrons and so
remain conducting.

The following are essential principles of Hess’s
law:
i. When a reaction is reversed, the enthalpy
change stays constant in magnitude but
becomes reversed in mathematical sign.
ii. When a reaction is multiplied by a factor
c, the enthalpy change is multiplied by the
same factor c.
iii. When two (or more) reactions are added
to obtain an overall reaction, the individual
enthalpy changes of each reaction are

Given a problem pertaining to thermodynamic favorability, have students think
through how enthalpy and/or entropy is driving the thermodynamic favorability of the
reaction. Have them pair up and explain their reasoning for whether or not the reaction
is thermodynamically favorable and what is driving that favorability. After the pairs
have discussed their responses, have them share with other pairs to get feedback on
their rationale.

Processes that are thermodynamically favored,

is a common reason for a process to be under

not proceed at a noticeable rate does not mean
that the chemical system is at equilibrium. If

Science Practice 6: Develop an explanation or scientific argument
The ability to formulate a coherent argument, that is, to make a claim that is clearly articulated and
supportedbyexperimentalevidence,isatthecoreofthescientificmethod.Theseargumentsarisefrom
the iterative processes of experimentation, observation, and interpretation. Claims (conclusions) made
by scientists are ultimately shared with the broader community for peer review and further validation.
Consequently, students need to practice:
§
Articulating a claim
§
Providing qualitative and/or quantitative evidence to support their claim
§
Justifying the inclusion or exclusion of particular pieces of evidence in supporting their claim
§
Connecting qualitative and/or quantitative evidence to chemical theories and models to justify their line

equaltothemagnitudeofΔH° for the reaction to form SO3 (g)? Justify your answer.
One point for indicating greater magnitude with a valid justification:.
•
Greater, because the enthalpy of SO3 (l ) is lower than the enthalpy of SO3 (g) (by an amount equal to the
enthalpy of vaporization of SO3 (l )), which makes the difference between the enthalpy of the reactants
and the enthalpy of the products a larger amount.

temperature of the reaction system is decreased? Justify your answer. 5.C
One point for indicating an increased thermodynamic favorability along with a valid justification. 9.3.A
• = −
ΔGrxn ΔHrxn TΔSrxn. Assuming that both ΔHrxn and ΔSrxn are constant, as the value of T is decreased,
−
the smaller in value the term (TΔSrxn) becomes, making the term (ΔHrxn TΔSrxn) more negative. Thus
ΔGrxn becomes more negative, increasing the thermodynamic favorability of the reaction.
